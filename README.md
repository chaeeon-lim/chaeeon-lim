### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Junior ML Engineer for EdgeAI in [Future Design Systems] in Daejeon, South Korea.

I've been working on how to accelerate Deep Learning models on [Field Programmable Gate Array(FPGA)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field-programmable_gate_array) such as Zedboard, Nexys Video, ...
I've contributed to make basic HLS source codes for Deep learning operations (e.g. Convolution, Linear, Batch Normalization, ...) \
-> check [Deep Learning Routines] (Due to the company credential, my contributions are not recorded in this repository. But you can see my name in the source codes [like this])

Check my works [Facemask Detection on FPGA along with Raspberry Pi4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDCTkTmQO9o&ab_channel=FutureDesignSystems)
